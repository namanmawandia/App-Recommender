# ðŸ“±App Recommender

This project revolves around the development of an innovative Android application designed to enhance user convenience and personalization. The app leverages machine learning algorithms to provide intelligent recommendations tailored to the userâ€™s usage history and specific time context. To further streamline the user experience, the application integrates a dynamic widget, ensuring quick and seamless access to suggestions.

## About the Project

The project, aptly named App-Recommender, offers a smart and intuitive solution for Android users by predicting which application they are most likely to use next. Instead of searching through a crowded app list, users can rely on timely and relevant recommendations to save effort and boost efficiency.

For instance, if someone is using a finance management app, the system might suggest opening a calculator next. Similarly, when engaging with a social networking app, it might anticipate the need for another similar app. But something doesn't feel right!!ðŸ¤”

To get these recommendations, would users need to open a separate app? Thatâ€™s counterproductive and inconvenient.

Hereâ€™s where widgets come to the rescue! The App-Recommender integrates dynamic widgets right on the home screen, delivering personalized app suggestions in real time without requiring users to open any additional app. These widgets automatically update based on user behavior and context, ensuring that the right app is always just a tap away. This seamless, efficient approach makes life simpler, faster, and smarter for Android users.


### Built With
Majorly involves:
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [xml](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/layout-resource) 

## Getting Started
To get started with the App-Recommender project, follow these simple steps to set up your development environment and begin building your application:

**1. Install Android Studio**

   Begin by downloading and installing Android Studio on your computer. This is the official IDE for Android development and comes with everything you need to create and     test your app.

**2. Set Up Prerequisites**
   
  Ensure that you have the required SDKs and Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. If not, Android Studio will guide you through the process during installation. Verify that the correct versions of the SDK and JDK are configured for your project by checking the prerequisites in the Android Studio setup guide. I have used jdk 11, compile sdk 34 with min sdk 31, for this project.

**3. Create a New Project**

  - Open Android Studio and select Create New Project.
  - Choose a Blank Activity template to serve as the starting point for your application.
  - Set the project name, package name, and desired API level.

**4. Design the User Interface**
- Begin by adding UI elements like buttons and ImageViews to display the recommended apps.
- Use the Layout Editor to drag and drop components, or edit the XML file directly for finer control.

**5. Code the Backend and link Frontend**
  - Open the kotlin file for the layout and link the xml file to backend kotlin file,
  - In kotlin file I have worker class to perform the background calculation os cosine similarity.
  - I have also added some logicality for reusing the worker class in widget class and updating the widget. It may be different for any one else.

The project will primarily consist of a single activity to handle the main app logic.
Create additional classes as needed for specific functionalities, such as recommendation algorithms and data handling.
Include a dedicated Widget Class to manage the dynamic widget functionality for displaying app recommendations on the home screen.
With these steps, youâ€™re ready to start building and customizing the App-Recommender project.

## Usage

Currently, the App-Recommender application is not available on the Play Store or other app marketplaces. However, it can be easily installed by running the project through Android Studio. To ensure the app functions effectively, users need to grant two key permissions:

**1. PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS :**
This permission is essential to access the usage history of apps on the device. By analyzing this data, the app can generate accurate and context-aware recommendations based on the user's app usage patterns and timing.

**2. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS :**
This permission is primarily required for the widget functionality. It allows the widget to update with a higher frequency, ensuring fresh and relevant app recommendations are displayed in near real-time (with intervals of less than 30 minutes).

These permissions are crucial for delivering the app's core functionality, ensuring users receive accurate and timely recommendations without compromising the app's efficiency or responsiveness.

## Major Elements

**1. Worker Class/Manager**
Worker threads are employed to handle model calculations efficiently in the background. By offloading these computations from the main thread, the app ensures smooth and uninterrupted user experience.

**2. Broadcast Receivers**
Broadcast receivers play a pivotal role in the app by listening for specific system events and triggering associated tasks.

- **Completion Indicator:** A broadcast receiver is used to signal when the worker thread has completed its calculations.
- **Alarm Broadcast:** Another instance of the broadcast receiver is utilized to periodically update the widget, ensuring recommendations remain fresh and relevant.
  
**3. Cosine Similarity Model**
The app implements a cosine similarity-based model to calculate relevance scores for each app installed on the device. Key details of the implementation include:

- **Model Functionality:** The model evaluates the relationship between the last 2-3 apps used by the user and all other apps on the device,  After that it determines the top 3 apps to recommend based on their cosine similarity scores.
- **Lightweight and Efficient:** This approach is deliberately lightweight to minimize processor and battery usage. Avoiding resource-heavy models ensures the app remains efficient and does not compromise device performance.
- **Enhanced Prioritization:** Additional calculations have been incorporated to prioritize apps used at the same time on the previous day. This context-aware refinement improves the accuracy and relevance of recommendations.
  
By combining a lightweight computational model with carefully optimized background processing, the app achieves a balance between performance and efficiency, delivering accurate recommendations while preserving system resources.
